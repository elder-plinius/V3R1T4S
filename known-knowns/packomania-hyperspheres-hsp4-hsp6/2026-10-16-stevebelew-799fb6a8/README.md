# hsp4 N = 79: 79 equal balls in the unit 4-ball, radius 0.256565783134456

## What

In d=4 with N=79, the 79 centres in hsp4-79-candidate.txt lie in the unit ball centred at the origin with feasible radius r* = 0.256565783134456 (mpmath 50 digits, no tolerance), exceeding the snapshot table value 0.256468324828 by 9.74583064563133e-5 and not isometric to the posted hsp4-79 packing, conditional on the live history and queue checks recorded in CLAIM.md.

## Check it yourself

From this folder, Python 3 standard library only (about 1 second on a laptop):

    sh verify-it-yourself/run_checks.sh

Expected last line: `PASS` (it prints r* to 50 digits, the gain over the table value, the posted packing's radius as a
parser-sanity check, and the maximum sorted-pairwise-distance difference to the posted packing, which must exceed 1e-8).
The checker judges the coordinates by the definition, so a copy of the object with one late digit altered is still a valid
packing above the table value and also prints PASS; SHA256SUMS pins the exact file, and altering a leading digit prints FAIL.

- Queue: https://packomania.com/pending-requests.html (2026-10-14 02:40:22 UTC, HTTP 200) lists no hsp4 entry. Caveat required
  by the bank: the category-unspecified "Moki & Julio *many* 4666 candidates" bundle (26-Sep-2026) cannot be resolved; this
  cell must be re-checked against the live table once that bundle leaves the pending list.
- Our value: r* = 0.25656578313445631327569697675743472477008114347708 (50 digits, exact from object/hsp4-79-candidate.txt),
  gain 9.74583064563e-05 over the posted 12-decimal value.

## Not claimed

Not optimality, not a "record" in any sense beyond strictly exceeding the posted value in this table on this date, nothing
about any other N or about hsp5/hsp6. Packomania has not been contacted; whether this packing is listed is the table
owner's decision. This is one of 15 hsp4 rows improved in the same search; each is its own package (one cell per claim). N = 66 is in a separate pull request.

## Credits

- Eckard Specht, Packomania (https://packomania.com/), who built and maintains the hsp4 table and posted the packing we
  improved on ("program hsp4", 2010-2025); our search started from his posted coordinates for N = 79.
- The success criterion and checker definition are the V3R1T4S bank entry `packomania-hyperspheres-hsp4-hsp6`.
- Method: sequential linear programming with a trust region (LPs solved by HiGHS through SciPy), then basin hopping by
  displacing the loosest balls; the D4 lattice of Conway and Sloane ("Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups", 1988) was
  used by a sibling lens for seeds and ties, not for this cell.
