# RUN_IT_YOURSELF.md

Exact commands, run from this package folder in a fresh shell. Needs only Python 3
(standard library).

## The one-command check
sh verify-it-yourself/run_checks.sh
# expected last line: PASS  (a few minutes on a laptop)

## What it does
1. `python3 verify-it-yourself/verify.py object/candidate_n4153.txt`
   - Parses the 4153 centers as exact decimals (no binary float), computes
     r* = min(min_{i<j}|c_i−c_j|/2, 1−max_i|c_i|) at 50 decimal digits.
   - Expected: r* = 0.01459912804413632909680425838614465154649…, table = 0.014596422226478759387097611060,
     margin = 2.706e-06 (need ≥ 1e-11) → PASS.
2. Builds a corrupted copy (one center duplicated onto another → zero pair distance) and checks the
   verifier rejects it (→ FAIL). Guards against a checker that passes everything.

## Rebuilding the object (how-we-built-it/)
The discovery code is in how-we-built-it/ (numpy/scipy needed). In brief:
1. Generate hexagonal truncations of ~4153 points (orientation θ, spacing s, offset):
   see wide_search.py (parameter search, 96,525 evaluations on the raw-truncation
   objective F = min(s/2, 1 − max|p|); best raw truncation θ=21.8037°, s=0.02915479).
2. Deep-polish the best four diverse truncations with smooth_max_polish (polish.py:
   L-BFGS-B on logsumexp(α·overlaps)/α, ratcheting r → feasible r each round).
   The best (theta 9.51 deg basin) polishes from a raw −2.042e-05 deficit to a
   certified +2.706e-06 surplus over the table.
The exact command history is in how-we-built-it/COMMANDS.txt.
