== known answer: merged certificate for A(31,12,10) must give 197
A(31,12,10): exact dual objective 8091/41 = 197.341463; floor 197; claimed U 197
certificate states lp_optimum 8091/41 match
primal point in certificate feasible: True  its objective: 8091/41
PASS: A(31,12,10) <= 197
== check_delsarte.py on object/cert_A29_6_13.json (exact dual feasibility, objective, floor)
A(29,6,13): exact dual objective 10715355/37 = 289604.189189; floor 289604; claimed U 289604
certificate states lp_optimum 10715355/37 match
primal point in certificate feasible: True  its objective: 10715355/37
PASS: A(29,6,13) <= 289604
checker verdict: PASS
== negative control 1: the same certificate checked against a claim one smaller must FAIL
negative control 1 rejected as expected
== negative control 2: a copy with every dual value multiplied by 99/100 must FAIL (dual infeasible)
negative control 2 rejected as expected
== negative control 3: a copy with one dual value set negative must FAIL
negative control 3 rejected as expected
ALL CHECKS PASS
