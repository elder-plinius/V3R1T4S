# Fast matrix multiplication: format 14x16x16 in rank 2159, class Z

## What

The file object/14x16x16_m2159_Z.json is an exact integer (class Z, largest absolute coefficient 6) bilinear scheme of rank 2159 for the 14x16x16 format whose Brent equations hold over Z, and rank 2159 is strictly below the Z rank 2170 in the live Perminov README table, not below the overall best rank 2128 and not matched by any Z-class scheme file in the two named repositories at the fetch time.

Path note: the sentence above is quoted word for word from `panel/gate.md`, and it names the panel's `claim/` folder. In this package the same scheme is `object/14x16x16_m2159_Z.json`.

**Encoding.** The panel checked the original file `object/14x16x16_m2159_Z.json` (dense rows, 3105711 bytes) with sha256 `b7a26ff2e48fc42540d7b837421651ac747fc9b6e8b69b745ddf78091f8dffd8`. That file is over the 1,000,000-byte limit, so this package holds a lossless re-encoding of it under the same name (`"encoding": "sparse_flat_pairs"`, 632672 bytes, sha256 `e6a4c45402117cbaf7655b4a7f678ada83795053cd102c24873a5f1100519e2d`). Entry-by-entry comparison with the original found no difference; see `verify-it-yourself/RECEIPTS.md`. `INDEX.csv` and `SHA256SUMS` carry the re-encoded file's hash, and the submission id uses it. `panel/gate.md` names the original's hash.

## Check it yourself

From this package folder, run:

```sh
sh verify-it-yourself/run_checks.sh
```

- **Requirements**: `python3` 3.8 or later, standard library only.
- **Rough laptop time**: under one minute.
- **Expected last line**: `ALL CHECKS PASS`

The run checks the object's sha256 against `INDEX.csv`, the Brent equations exactly over the integers (no floating point, no sampling), the coefficient class, and that a copy with one sign flipped is rejected.

Live Perminov row, verbatim: `| `14x16x16` |  2170 (?)   |   2170 (?)   | 2128 (2142)  |   2.808914234   |`. The panel's novelty skeptic fetched every source above; its report is `panel/novelty.md`. The claim folder's own earlier fetch (2026-10-18T13:47:52Z, same README sha256) is in `the-record-we-beat/README.md`, with HTTP status and page sha256.

## Not claimed

- Only the Z (integer) column is claimed. Nothing is claimed for any other coefficient class of this format.
- The scheme does not beat the best known rank for this format over the rationals (Q rank 2128; fmm_sota 2128). It is an improvement for the Z column only.
- This is a rank bound for one format and does not improve the asymptotic exponent of matrix multiplication.
- Not peer reviewed. It was checked by a three-skeptic panel (`panel/`) and by the standalone checker shipped here.
