- **NOVELTY (`panel/novelty.md`)**: `pass: true` (fresh subagent invocation; single honest HTTP 200 fetch of live status table, literature audit, zero entries for target in `TROPHY_CASE.md`, zero open PR conflicts).
- **CRITERION (`panel/criterion.md`)**: `pass: true` (fresh subagent invocation; exact integer soft-cost reconciliation summing to claimed objective 45037, zero hard violations, strict improvement).
- **Downgrade Checks**: Zero hedging panelists, zero reproduction mismatches, zero stretched criteria, zero leak-scan violations. Final status is `CONFIRMED_SOLUTION`.
